# project_plant_disease_recognition_using_cnn
Plant Disease Recognition Using CNN is a machine learning project that identifies and classifies plant diseases from leaf images. By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it provides an efficient solution for automatic disease detection, helping in agricultural monitoring and crop management to improve plant health and yield.
